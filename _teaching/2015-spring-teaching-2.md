This class introduces the basic types of geophysical data used to characterize the subsurface. Learn about seismic refraction and reflection, gravity, magnetics, heat flow, and electromagnetic methods.

Course Summary
======

In this course, we look at the structure and the motion of material in the Earth’s interior. This includes answering questions such as:
*	What are plate tectonics and what causes plates to move?
*	What processes lead to volcanism and where is melt present in the Earth’s interior?
*	What are the major structures inside the Earth and what processes lead to the formation of these structures?
We are using tools from mathematics and physics, and in particular computer modeling, to address these questions. In addition, we discuss the constraints on these problems provided by paleomagnetism, mineral physics, seismology, volcanology, geochemistry, petrology, and other disciplines.
