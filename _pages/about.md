About me
======

Research
------
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Geological Sciences of the University of Florida, working with [Dr. Courtney Sprain](https://sites.google.com/site/courtneyjsprain/), [Dr. Juliane Dannberg](https://jdannberg.github.io/) and [Dr. Rene Gassmoeller](https://gassmoeller.github.io/) to bring together the scientific fields of paleomagnetism, geodynamics, and geodynamo modelling. In my research, I am using numerical simulations of Earth’s geodynamo and global mantle convection to create models of the geomagnetic field that can be compared to paleomagnetic data in order to study the evolution of Earth’s deep interior on million-to-billion-year time scales. In addition, I am trying to find points in Earth’s past where the geomagnetic field behaved significantly different from the present-day field by studying small and large anomalies in magnetic field strength that are preserved in archaeological materials and the geological record.
